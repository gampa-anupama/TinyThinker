# TinyThinker – AI-Powered PDF Q&A Chatbot

**TinyThinker** is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content.

It integrates:
- A modern React frontend for the user interface  
- A Node.js backend for request handling and LLM communication  
- A lightweight Flask microservice to parse PDF files and extract text

🧠 How It Works
User uploads a PDF via the frontend

The PDF is sent to the Flask parser, which extracts raw text

The Node.js backend formats the prompt using the text and sends it to an LLM (e.g., TinyLlama)

The response is returned and displayed in the chat interface

### ✅ Summary of Fix

- Your issue was because the **folder structure block (` ``` `)** was **never closed**.
- Now it ends right after the folder tree.
- All other sections are regular markdown text — no longer inside the code block.

Would you like me to save this to a `README.md` file and send it for download?
