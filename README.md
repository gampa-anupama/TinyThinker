# TinyThinker – AI-Powered PDF Q&A Chatbot

**TinyThinker** is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on their content.

It integrates:
- A modern React frontend for the user interface  
- A Node.js backend for request handling and LLM communication  
- A lightweight Flask microservice to parse PDF files and extract text

How It Works
User uploads a PDF via the frontend

The PDF is sent to the Flask parser, which extracts raw text

The Node.js backend formats the prompt using the text and sends it to an LLM (e.g., TinyLlama)

The response is returned and displayed in the chat interface

You can now **copy-paste this directly** into your `README.md` and GitHub will render it perfectly — no unwanted code blocks around text.

Would you like me to generate a downloadable `.md` file too?
