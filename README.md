# TinyThinker â€“ AI-Powered PDF Q&A Chatbot

TinyThinker is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions based on the content within. It uses a modern React frontend, a Node.js backend for handling requests and integrating with a lightweight LLM, and a Flask-based PDF parser for extracting text from documents.
